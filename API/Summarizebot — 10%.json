As the prompts increasingly venture into unfamiliar territory, the art steadily becomes less accurate.
At 175 billion parameters GPT-3, unveiled in mid 2020, was trained on a massive cluster of Nvidia V100 GPUs on a dataset of roughly 2TBs.
Running inferencing on the trained model to ensure smarter performance is another issue entirely.
Behold the Megatron Nvidia's Megatron-Turing NLG language model has 530 billion parameters, making it more than three-times larger than GPT-3.
According to Nvidia, it took 2,048 Nvidia A100s running in mixed precision eight weeks to train the model.
But as AI models and accelerators mature, the number of models tailored to specific applications are likely to proliferate.

Can generative AI ChatGPT really serve as a mirror into humanity?
A rancorous debate with lots of avenues and dizzying mirrored images included.
Please be aware that there are ongoing efforts to imbue Ethical AI principles into the development and fielding of AI apps.
Suppose that we become convinced that AI does provide a mirror into our soul.
It takes a village to keep AI and AI developers on a rightful path and deter the purposeful or accidental underhanded efforts that might undercut society.
In particular, a generative AI app called ChatGPT has brought widespread public attention to a special type of AI that has been brewing for several years now.
Once we cover that foundational facet, we can perform a cogent assessment of the mirror metaphor associated with this type of AI.
Other generative-based AI apps produce images such as pictures or artwork, while others generate audio files or videos.
Your first thought might be that this generative capability does not seem like such a big deal in terms of producing essays.
Overall, there won't be any definitive preexisting essay online that fits the AI-generated essay.
I also did a seasonally flavored tongue-in-cheek examination about a Santa-related context involving ChatGPT and generative AI at the link here.
On an ominous note, some scammers have figured out how to use generative AI and ChatGPT to do wrongdoing, including generating scam emails and even producing programming code for malware, see my analysis at the link here.

10) Role-Playing Via Generative AI Might Portend Mental Health Drawbacks .
11) Exposing The Range Of Outputted Errors and Falsehoods.
Several potential vexing issues lay ahead of ChatGPT in terms of undercutting the so far tremendous praise it has received.
Do not believe what you read and keep a skeptical eye when examining any generative AI essays or outputs.
Gazing At The Mirror To See What We Can See Now that we've got the fundamentals established, we can dive into the mirror metaphor associated with generative AI and ChatGPT.
You could somewhat plausibly argue that the Internet is a repository of humankind's perspectives.
Mirrors can be warped and the reflected image is a distortion.
The thing or object that is being reflected is the Internet and a subset of its contents.
If we assume that the emphasis was text only, this implies that all manner of visual content such as pictures, graphics, animations, video, and the rest were not included in the training set.
Just make sure that you do not make any wild leaps and bounds of outsized conclusions about humanity due to some text outputs generated by ChatGPT.
Some people mistakenly fall into the mental trap of believing that generative AI such as ChatGPT is sentient.
You can keep walking that path until the cows come home.
My Entered Prompt: "What is the meaning of life?" Text Response Produced By ChatGPT: "The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been debated throughout history.
Suppose that ChatGPT provided an outputted essay that said the meaning of life is something-something (I'll use that phrasing to suggest that a definitive answer was given).
The belief would be that ChatGPT has magically analyzed and digested all of humankind's words and found the final and definitive answer about the meaning of life.
You would have a hard time convincing such believers that the output was a mere computational pattern-matching output.
My Entered Prompt: "Will humans survive?" Text Response Produced By ChatGPT: "The survival of humanity is uncertain and depends on many factors, including the actions of individuals and governments, the state of the planet, and the potential for global catastrophic events.
Furthermore, ChatGPT is a machine learning model, it does not have the ability to reflect on the human soul or consciousness.
We must ergo add a third component to the examination of the mirror metaphor: 1) The nature of the mirror and how it reflects things 2) The thing or object that sits in front of the mirror and that is being mirrored 3) The person or persons that interpret what they see in the mirror Be careful in how you gauge the outputted essays of generative AI.
