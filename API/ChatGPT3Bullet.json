    • A generative-AI chatbot named ChatGPT was asked for relationship advice by Insider.
    • Four online and in-person dating coaches gave their feedback on the advice provided by ChatGPT, with some of them finding it impressive but none of them thinking their jobs were at risk.
    • The coaches noted that AI lacks the human qualities of tone, intuition, and emotion and that there are deeper layers to relationships that AI cannot access. Some of the advice given by ChatGPT was seen as lacking specificity, such as omitting the difference in approach between men and women and the role of videos in online dating profiles.
